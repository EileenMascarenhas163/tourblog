The museum also focuses on the history of the “anti-colonial movement, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Komagata Maru incident, the All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, and the journey of resilience and recuperation for women”. The building wherein the museum is located in Amritsar was also “once the British headquarters and a jail”. The museum was inaugurated on 25 August 2017.</p>
