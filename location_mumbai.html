                    <p>The Bandra–Worli Sea Link, officially called Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link, is a cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts on either side that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai. The bridge is a part of the proposed Western Freeway that will link the Western Suburbs to Nariman Point in Mumbai's main business district.The bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), and built by the Hindustan Construction Company. The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge were opened to the public on 30 June 2009. All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010.The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak hours from 60–90 minutes to 20–30 minutes. As of October 2009, BWSL had an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles.HistoryMahim Causeway was the only road connecting the western suburbs to Mumbai's central business district.</p>

                    <p>The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation Hall near Gorai, North-west of Mumbai, India. The Pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, then President of India on 8 February 2009.[1] It is built on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to the Buddha, his teaching and the community of monks practicing his teaching. Its traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of Vipassana. The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda) in Yangon, Myanmar. It was built combining ancient Indian and modern technology to enable it to last for a thousand years. The center of the Global Vipassana Pagoda contains the world's largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars.</p>

                <div class="back">
                    <p>One of the most popular hangout spots for young and old alike, Marine Drive at Night is an otherworldly experience. A city that is constantly on its feet at any given time of the day, Mumbai is known as the city that never sleeps. Its spirit is indomitable and the pace is hurried. However, the feeling of cool ocean breeze blowing at night as the lights along the marine drive glitter like stars, provides a welcome respite. It is not uncommon to find youngsters taking a leisurely drive along its coast from all parts of Mumbai. You can grab a soothing cup of chai or coffee that is sold by street vendors, grab a snack to eat, or simply smoke a cigarette while listening to music. In recent times there have been instances of police patrolling along the road to reprimand miscreants so, make sure that while you enjoy your peaceful time, you are also respectful of the people around. The queen's necklace - as it is also referred to - is a great place to enjoy your solitude.</p>

                    <p>The Hanging Gardens, in Mumbai, also known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens, are terraced gardens perched at the top of Malabar Hill, on its western side, just opposite the Kamala Nehru Park. They provide sunset views over the Arabian Sea and feature numerous hedges carved into the shapes of animals. The park was designed and laid out in 1881 by Ulhas Ghatkopar over Bombay's main reservoir, some say to cover the water from the potentially contaminating activity of the nearby Towers of Silence. When seen from the air, the walkway inside the park, spell out the letters PMG in cursive.</p>
